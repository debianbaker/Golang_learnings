# My Go Learning Journey
Hi !, this showcases my progress in GoLang - from the complete basics.
This is my personal notebook on Go and let's hope that i build something that appeals to me using Go.

# But Why Go?
I was learning Distributed Systems, from MIT(Spring 2020) and i needed to know Goroutines and Concurrency. I need to learn Raft and more advanced concepts built on Go. It feels amazing really, from the time I learnt that Go is used in threading and for backend purposes in the DS. 

## Topics Covered - 
- Mandated to changes as I progress.

# DAY1: 
- Go run - [tutorial1]
1. Initialize Module - go mod init Golang_Learnings
2. Compile - go build [file].go
3. Run - ./[file]  OR directly compile & run - go run [file].go
