# My Go Learning Journey
Hi !, this showcases my progress in GoLang - from the complete basics.
This is my personal notebook on Go and let's hope that i build something that appeals to me using Go.

# But Why Go?
I was learning Distributed Systems, from MIT(Spring 2020) and i needed to know Goroutines and Concurrency. I need to learn Raft and more advanced concepts built on Go. It feels amazing really, from the time I learnt that Go is used in threading and for backend purposes in the DS.
